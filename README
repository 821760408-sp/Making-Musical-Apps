The sample projects in this repository are set up with the assumption
that this repository has been cloned into the same parent folder as
pd-for-android and pd-for-ios.  For example, you can clone them all into
your Documents folder.

When importing the sample project for Android into Eclipse, make sure to
select "Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace".  If you
see spurious errors, have Eclipse clean and rebuilt your workspace.
